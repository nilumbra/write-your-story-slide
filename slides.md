# Bear witness
- Sometimes we just let bad things happen to us, or ignore it, or pretend they didn't happen
- Passively observing something ≠ the action of bearing witness
- Bearing witness means to **write** down something we have experienced

# Step 1: Brainstorm and Write them Down
- Prompt: “the time when...” 
  - Something you could've intervened but didn't. and you might feel regret, unfair, anger, etc.
- List 10(or maybe just several) such things
- Help to unburden yourselves and to un-silence things

# Step 2: Narrow down and Focus
- Pick 3 things that really tug at you, that make you feel “I must write about it”
- Sit down for 30 minutes and write, continuously 
- Focus on 3 things 
  1. Details 
  2. Order of the event 
  3. **How did it make you feel** (important!!)

# Step 3: Pick one and Tell the story
- Might sound daunting, but remember we are natural storytellers!
  - e.g. remember how you would talk to your best friend about something that really made you feel excited about(or upset you...)
- Could be any form
  - a letter to a friend, or to your younger/older self 
  - a song, a parody, a poem, nursery rhyme
- Help to take back some power that was taken from you...
